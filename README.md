## Overview
  I have created Connect 4. I used to play connect 4 a lot when i was younger. 


### How it works
  The user waves their curser over the top of the boared and you will see a chip apper at the top. Click the colum you want to drop the chip in. the chip drops right above the last chip in the colum or to the bottom.
